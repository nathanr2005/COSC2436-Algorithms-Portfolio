Lab: "Cheapest Route" -- Weighted Graphs and Dijkstra's Algorithm

Part 1: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm (dict-of-dicts weighted graph).
Part 2: Compare BFS "fewest hops" vs Dijkstra "lowest cost" on a small
        San Francisco style map (Twin Peaks -> Golden Gate Bridge).
Part 3: Break Dijkstra's algorithm on purpose with a negative-weight edge.

All graphs below are hardcoded literals -- no randomness, no file I/O --
so the autograder can check exact costs, parents, and paths.
