Lab: "Write It Down Once" -- Dynamic Programming

    # Reflection (answer in comments, no code required):
    #
    # 1. What has to be true about a problem for the grid/DP approach to
    #    work at all? (Hint: subproblems that don't depend on each other,
    #    so each cell can be computed once and reused.) A DP grid works when a problem can be broken into smaller subproblems whose answers can be calculated once and reused.
    
    #
    # 2. Name a real tool you've used that is built on this same idea
    #    (e.g. spell-check suggestions, `git diff`, DNA sequence
    #    alignment). Why does it need a DP-style grid? Git diff uses this idea to compare files and find their differences efficiently by comparing smaller parts of the files.
